# Introduction
In this workshop you will learn about requirements, how to collect them and how to write them down. To be able to document the requirements for the CargoHub API we need to develop a basic understanding of RESTful APIs and how to read them. That's why RESTful API reading practice is included in this workshop. But first: requirements.

## Objectives:
- Understand the principles of REST and its application in software development.
- Learn how to gather, analyze, and document software requirements.
- Apply REST principles to design and implement a simple RESTful API.
- Integrate software requirements into the development process.
- Retrieve requirements from existing, undocumented software.

## Why requirements?
Well, try to build something with just a *single* requirement:

- We need a bridge to cross over

### Activity
Suppose you are tasked to build this bridge. How would you proceed?

Take some time to write down your strategy.

### Possible answer
First you need to recognize that this requirement is not very helpful. You need more information to proceed. For example: where should the bridge be build? Is it to cross a river or a road? From that you could derive how long the bridge would need to be. You should also need to know if the bridge is for pedestrians, for cyclist and/or for cars. This determines the strength, the width and the material, which in turn determines the costs of the bridge. Etcetera.

> Without requirements we don't know *what* to build and, as a result, *how* to build it.

Notice the difference between **what** and **how**:

- Requirements are about *what* to build
- Design is about *how* to build it

The design (of the system, user experience and interface) always *follows* from the requirements. Given the time, money and resources, it is the task of the (software) engineer to come up with an optimal solution that fits the requirements.

> Engineering is about building an optimal solution. Every decision you make will be about juggling multiple requirements.

## Requirement gathering
Going back to the bridge building example: the asking for clarity is the process of gathering requirements.

> During the project the technical teacher knows about the details and it is up to you to ask for clarification.

In reality we start with more than one requirement and during the gathering phase we try te refine the demands and needs such that we can build the right thing.

Speaking of the 'right thing':

- Good **requirements** ensure that we build *the right thing*
- Good **design** ensures that that we build *the thing right*

It really depends on the experience of the team and the complexity & nature of the project which requirments need be known up front, and which can be left to be refined during the project.

### Activity
Try to explain what the items below have in common and what makes them different:

- Building a chair
- Building an airplane
- Building a thesis evaluation tool for teachers

### Possible answers
Although a chair and airplane differ in complexity, their goal is pretty clear. Given the constraints (size, speed, weight, ...), one could start planning the construction process pretty soon: we can adopt a waterfall process.

This cannot be said about the thesis evaluation tool. What should it even do? Here we need to do a lot of research up front and adjusting during the process to build the right thing: we should choose for an agile approach.

- With *lots of unknows* an **agile approach** may be preferred
- With *little unknowns* a **waterfall method** may be preferred

### Activity
Reading the course manual, what would be a good approach for this project for your team?

## Summary
We need requirements else we don't know what to build.

In the next chapter we will look at different types of requirements.
